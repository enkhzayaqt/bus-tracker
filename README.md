# Bus tracker project

## About the project

This project is when you click a button maker moves through map and shows my everyday route from home to work. This code originated from an assignment in Week #9 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to animate and add features to a map. I have used mapbox. 

## How to run:

You can fork this repository into your computer and open the file on your code editor.
Create account in the mapbox : https://www.mapbox.com/ . Once you created your own account you will get your own token key.
Put your token key instead of my token key in the Javascript file. 

## Roadmap to future improvements:

I am planning to improve the map to add and implement real time train movement.
